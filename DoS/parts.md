  This is called a <b> Network Adapter </b> or a <b> Network Interface Card (NIC) </b>. The purpose of this device is to allow a computer or device connect to a network like the one you have at home. It let's those devices communicate with other devices over the internet to perform any task given.

  Now, this is a <b> router </b> which works with the network adapter. Think of the router like a traffic cop. If you want to communicate with other devices, the router helps distribute this communication to the right devices. This may seem a bit confusing so here's another way to picture it. Think of a <b> network adapter </b> like a notebook. You're going to use this notbook to write down ideas (data) with others. Every student (device) will need a notebook to communicate in class. Think of the <b> router </b> like a teacher. She's in charge in distributing these notebooks to the right students, so everyone gets the correct notes. The teacher is the one who is going to keep the class running.
