  The software we will need to download is <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads"> Oracle Virtual Box </a> with the host Operating System you are using. To do this, please check out any YouTube video such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsZxuiU0uZ4&t=315s"> This Video </a>. In this case, we will be using Kali Linux for our virtual machine (VM).

  Now if we take a look, our host operating system is Windows. This is what manages all the software and hardware within my computer. Most people usually use a computer with Windows as it is very easy to use. Now, if we take a look at the application open on the left, it says <b> Kali Linux </b>. This is also another type of OS, however, this is a Linux distribution different from Windows. The reason I am using Kali Linux for my VM is because it is mainly used for digital forensics and penetration testing which I will be using.
